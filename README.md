 ## File Overview

 ### ← README.md

 - This is a website that you can learn more about mental health and share your stories in it.
 - I used a lot of HTML in this project.
 - To build this project it's recommended that you create a js for each html file.


 ### ← index.html

- Center some of the text in html already.

 ### ← style.css

 - I used dark gray and yellow.
 - Two different fonts

 ### ← script.js

 - Create one js for each HTML.

 ### ← assets

 Drag in `assets`, like images or music, to add them to your project. You do not need to add anything to this folder unless you are working on the extensions. If you are adding an image, it is best to save it to your computer, then upload the file to the `assets` folder. The url of the image will be `assets/example.jpg`.
